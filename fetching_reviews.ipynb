      "Cris Jackbottom 5 Me and my college friends went to this restaurant to celebrate the end of college exams. We ordered honey chilli potatoes , chilli chicken, momos etc and they all were incredible. Specially chilli chicken which was just amazing. Staff was super fast in preparing food and the quality of crowd was amazing too. Other thing that I liked about it is the incredible ambience the restaurant had. Overall our experience was just amazing.\n",
